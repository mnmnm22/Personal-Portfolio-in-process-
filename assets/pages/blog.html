        <h1>Week 2 Blog Post</h1>

        <p>
        The topic I’m grounding on for my project is my “personal writing archive,” specifically stories I wrote during my childhood up until now. Storytelling has been a big part of my identity and creative life. I want to document it and reflect on how my ideas and voice have evolved.
        I remember first starting writing during elementary school because of a writing contest my school was holding. I’m a very competitive person, so I wanted to win. I think it was something about dragons and fantasy and a group of friends trying to save their village from doom. I only got third place, but the process of writing gave me so much ecstasy, I thought, “Why not keep going?” I began writing more fantasy stories, and I even remember writing a fantasy series that I thought was going to be a bestselling trilogy (spoiler: it was never finished). I was like eleven years old, but a girl can dream. Even though most of these stories were written just for fun, they each kind of show what I cared about or how I saw the world at the time. I went from fantasy to mystery—who murdered the cheerleader in town or something like that. It was with that genre that I entered next year’s contest again, and this time I got first place. Ever since then, I haven’t stopped. I’ve explored different genres like romance, fiction, and historical. Even though most of them are just fun projects I haven’t really thought much of (most of them unfinished too), they’re pretty fun and help keep me grounded during hard times.
        For this project, I’m thinking of including a mix of typed-up versions and maybe pictures of my brainstorming notes or outlines from my story process. That feels like a more personal, creative way of “archiving” than just uploading PDFs.
        In terms of “ways of knowing,” I think memory and emotion play a huge part in how I’ll build this archive. A traditional archive might just focus on the final drafts, but mine is more about process: the cringey story drafts, the forgotten plot holes, the inspiration behind certain characters. I want to treat those imperfect pieces as important parts of the story, too. It’s not just about what I wrote, but also why I wrote it.
        I guess this challenges traditional ways of archiving because I’m not presenting polished, professional work. I’m archiving unfinished thoughts, childhood dreams, and a creative journey that’s still ongoing. It’s kind of exciting to treat those as valuable and worth remembering.
